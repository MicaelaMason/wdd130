        <h2>Micaela Mason</h2>
        <p>I love my family! My husband and I spend most of our social time with his sister and her family. She has four
            adorable kids. I love life, we have a dog, fish, shrimp, snails, and lots and lots of plants. I'd have more
            but we live in an apartment right now. I love learning new things. I like to develop a new skill every few
            months. My goal in life is to never stop learning. I have had a rough last few semesters, my health hasn't
            been great, my family has hit one bump after another, and something always seems to go wrong. I hope that I
            can manage to complete this semester despite the trials in my way.</p>
