        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>To provide a thrilling encounter with nature and educate our visitors on the importance and beauty of the
            natural world around us.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>We target youth and families with a particular interest in school-aged children. We mix education and fun.
            Why sit in a classroom or at home learning about rivers, wildlife, and nature preservation when you could be
            part of it? Our students are caught up in a world of screens. They may hear about global warming and
            ecological disasters on the news, but be unaware of the causes, impacts, and solutions to these problems.
            They may want to help, but be unsure how they can or pessimistic about their ability to help. We seek to
            educate these kids, give them the answers and skills to help the enviroment while having fun. What they
            learn today may help save the world tomorrow.</p>
